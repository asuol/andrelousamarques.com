# Locally run the site for development purposes

Ensure you have the `hugo/andrelousamarques:v1` docker image built using

> make build

And then launch the site locally with

> make run

Docker will mount the `andrelousamarques` folder as a volume and serve the site at `localhost:1313`

# Update theme

```
make sh

cd andrelousamarques

hugo mod get -u github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack/v3
```

# How this site was bootstraped

This section is for context on how this website was bootstrapped.

> make build

On an empty directory, run:

> make sh

A docker container shell will open at the current host folder. In there run:

```
# Create a new Hugo site (on a new folder named after the site)
# Note regarding gitlab (no longer applicable): the `before_script` target of the gitlab_ci pipeline must ensure that the working directory is the created "andrelousamarques" directory otherwise it wont deploy the page
hugo new site andrelousamarques

# Since we will install the theme as a hugo module, the `mod init` command should be run on an empty directory
hugo mod init gitlab.com/gzhsuol/andrelousamarques

# Download the hugo theme module
hugo mod get github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack/v3
```

And add the content as needed.
