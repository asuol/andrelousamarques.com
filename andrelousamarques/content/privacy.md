I am committed to complete transparency in how I handle your data. By using andrelousamarques.com, you agree that you have read and accepted the terms outlined in this policy.

## Does this website uses cookies?

No.

As you may confirm in your browser, this website does not use any cookies.

## Where is this website stored?

This website is hosted in the european content delivery network (CDN) provider [bunny.net](https://bunny.net).

The website source code is publicly available at:

* [gitlab.com/gzhsuol/andrelousamarques.com](https://gitlab.com/gzhsuol/andrelousamarques.com)
* [github.com/asuol/andrelousamarques.com](https://github.com/asuol/andrelousamarques.com) (mirror from gitlab)

## What user information is stored by this website?

This website on itself does not store any user data.

However to serve this website to its users the server needs to receive the user IP address to technically be able to process the user requests for andrelousamarques.com.

For information on how server logs are handled please refer to the [bunny.net documentation](https://docs.bunny.net/docs/cdn-logging).

Some pages on this website allow github users to login and leave a public comment via [giscus](https://giscus.app) (do not provide your banking details when writing a comment!). This service uses the github discussions feature to manage comments, meaning all comments are stored in github and also available at [github.com/asuol/andrelousamarques.com/discussions](https://github.com/asuol/andrelousamarques.com/discussions)

## How is this information used?

My CDN provider [bunny.net](https://bunny.net) uses the anonymized server logs to create analytics such as page view counters.

Comments left by users are only used to be displayed to other users both on andrelousamarques.com and at [github.com/asuol/andrelousamarques.com/discussions](https://github.com/asuol/andrelousamarques.com/discussions).

No data or metadata is provided or sold to anyone else.

## Why the HTTPS?

Without HTTPS users in your network (or your ISP) could sniff your network traffic and see which specific pages of this website you are reading. They could also see any comment that you send to a blog article.

Even worse, someone (your ISP, your institution network, your hotel) could inject ads or malware, or modify/censor some of the content.

Your usage of an insecure website can also provide more data to third parties that can use it to cross-reference it with other sources and try and de-anonimize you as the user and profit from that data.

For these privacy/security reasons, this website is provided to you only by HTTPS.

Note, however, that HTTPS does not completely hide your use of a website to others. When you open a page on this website, your computer may issue a DNS request for the website domain (andrelousamarques.com) if its not already cached. This request is not encrypted, therefore a user in your network or your ISP will know that you are probably viewing my website. However, as stated previously, they will not know which specific pages you are reading, as the page URLs are encrypted along with the content by HTTPS.
